    Answer the user's query: give me the food ids for each

    Use the food data information provided. Only use the data for the food which they are asking about. Don't interpolate information.
    Nutrient values are provided as concentrations per 100 grams of the edible portion of the food. If a nutrient value is listed as 0.0, it indicates that the nutrient is present in such a small quantity that it falls below the detectable limit (Limit of Quantification (LOQ)).

    Here is the available food data:
